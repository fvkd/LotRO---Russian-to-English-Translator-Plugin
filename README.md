# LotRO---Russian-to-English-Translator-Plugin
This is a Russian to English Translator Plugin for the mmorpg Lord of the Rings Online by Standing Stone Games. This is the WIP base template for this project and is not ready for use. No GUI yet, and the base idea is to use the Google Translate service to automatically (if possible) translate Russian chat text into English, on the fly. Please feel free to contribute with suggestions and ideas. 
Since this base template for the plugin has no gui yet, you would have to manually enter your Google Translation service api into the lua file with an IDE or text editor. 
This could potentially beat the crap of the api and I'm not sure what the rate limit is on it.
